This document lays out a project plan for the development of the “SocialEase” social media web application system by “SocialEase”.

The intended readers of this document are current and future developers working on “SocialEase”. The plan will include, but is not restricted to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective of the “SocialEase” team (me and my mentors), scheduling and delivery estimates, the process by which I will develop the project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.

The primary objective of this application is to create a user-friendly platform that facilitates communication, community building, and content sharing.
